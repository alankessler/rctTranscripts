Sure, my CAT shows me clogged in normal, but yeah, I'm at my layover right now waiting to start, so I can... Now, do you want the battery turned off, or just a normal dial turned off? Well, let's start with just the normal dial, and then if that doesn't work, I'll get you set up with the supervisor or the truck at some point to do a radio reset on your radio. Okay, turning off now, thank you. Not a problem. If you need to get in touch with this batch, make sure to use the fallback method, which is just, you know, your handset, like a two-way radio. Wait for two seconds before you give your block in a location. Okay, I'm using hearing aids. Let's save that last part again.

They do not have ink in them as a heat transfer. So have you printed numerous tickets? Sometimes if you print like 10 or 15 in a row, it kind of heats it up to where it'll print out the ticket better. OK, unaware of that, but keep that in mind.

I can get the extra service bus set up to fill a portion of their run. That sounds great. You can do that. Perfect. Extra service 734. Let's make your way to Weidler.

You have a group pickup on southeast 168th, but then it's not showing that it's been sent to your manifest. Is that what you're calling about? Actually I was calling about 2252 cause I was there and I knocked twice, rang a bell, nobody ever came, I hung the door hanger, started walking back to the bus and then finally a guy came out after I'm already at like 8 minutes and he's like oh yeah, oh I didn't, sorry, didn't hear you. Then I had to wait like almost another 5 minutes so I'm like way behind. Copy that. Is he on board now? He is. I hung the door hanger and I was walking away but then the guy caught me so I still take him right even though I'm like way late. Yeah, unfortunately, yeah, I mean even I've had drivers full on push the no shuttle button and get ready to take off but TriMet says if they show up that we're supposed to take him cause it wastes less resources theoretically to do that then send another bus for him. Yeah love, I really wish that there was something I could do for you. Your route is literally just group ride after group ride. I'll try and do some wiggling later on after this next bunch that's going to east side, see what I can do for you about that one. Are you seeing the group pickup? It's 1, 2, 3, 4. Is 5 passengers picking up from southeast 168? Is that showing on your manifest? Oh yep, it just transferred over, okay. Yep, I pick him up every Monday. I pick him up and then I pick up the 5.

Police have not arrived from the scene yet, but the car is kind of parked there. Currently, traffic is getting around it. It's really backed up, but it is getting around it. You might want to set a supervisor in case he just had to block the intersection. Okay, and that was Stark and 187th westbound. It's just blocking the right lane at this point, correct? Affirmative. That's all correct. All right. We'll get somebody to check it out. Thanks for letting me know how many vehicles were involved in it. It looks like it may just be two. I saw one that was parked off to this side on 187th on the north side of Stark, or just north of Stark, I should say, but there was only, like I said, the one vehicle in the intersection, so it was hard to tell, but I'm pretty sure it was just two vehicles. All right. Copy that. Well, thanks for letting me know. Let me check it out and hope you have a great rest of your day. You as well. Thank you very much. 1523. <br /></td></tr>

Well, I made it through, but there is a three car accident and it's in the east outline. I copy. That's probably why the 9 headed the other way so much later. Ok, we'll get a supervisor out there and check it out when we get a chance. Ok, yeah, none of that traffic is getting through and people who are eastbound are doing U-turns. I copy. You don't think that 9 headed the other way is going to be able to get through? No, ma'am. I copy. I will give them a call and see if I can get them out of there. Thank you so much for the information. I appreciate it. 1753. <br /></td></tr>
